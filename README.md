I will learn R and analyze literary data with it. I will analyze Indian Writings in English and this will form the basis of my PhD research. I will be diligent and work hard every day. I will enjoy the process and maybe my hardwork will pay off. I want to go to Harvard or yale or to any Ivy league institute. I want to be counted amongst the greats.
